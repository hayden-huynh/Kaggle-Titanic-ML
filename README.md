# [Kaggle Competition: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview)
- This repository documents my attempts at the Titanic - ML from Disaster competition on Kaggle. Click on the title link to learn more
- In this repository, you will find:
    - The Jupyter notebook hosted on [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html), in which I implement my machine learning model to compete in the challenge
    - The dataset files which I use to train and test my model
- The goal is to predict the survivability of passengers on the Titanic based on different attributes of a passenger. If you are learning ML like me, this competition is a great place to start!
